## Application repositories

The following repositories use this package productively, which can be referred to as examples:

- [QEDFeynmanDiagrams.jl](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDFeynmanDiagrams.jl): Compute differential cross-sections of scattering processes in perturbative QED. Successor of QEDFeynman.jl below.
- **deprecated** [QEDFeynman](https://github.com/ComputableDAGs/QEDFeynman.jl): Compute differential cross-sections of scattering processes in ABC and QED models.
