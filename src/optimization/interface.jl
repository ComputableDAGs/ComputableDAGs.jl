Abstract base type for optimizer implementations.

"""
    optimize_step!(optimizer::AbstractOptimizer, graph::DAG)

Interface function that must be implemented by implementations of [`AbstractOptimizer`](@ref). Returns `true` if an operations has been applied, `false` if not, usually when a fixpoint of the algorithm has been reached.

It should do one smallest logical step on the given [`DAG`](@ref), muting the graph and, if necessary, the optimizer's state.
"""

"""
    optimize!(optimizer::AbstractOptimizer, graph::DAG, n::Int)

Function calling the given optimizer `n` times, muting the graph. Returns `true` if the requested number of operations has been applied, `false` if not, usually when a fixpoint of the algorithm has been reached.

If a more efficient method exists, this can be overloaded for a specific optimizer.

    fixpoint_reached(optimizer::AbstractOptimizer, graph::DAG)

Interface function that can be implemented by optimization algorithms that can reach a fixpoint, returning as a `Bool` whether it has been reached. The default implementation returns `false`.

Interface function that can be implemented by optimization algorithms that can reach a fixpoint. The algorithm will be run until that fixpoint is reached, at which point [`fixpoint_reached`](@ref) should return true.

A usual implementation might look like this:
```julia
    function optimize_to_fixpoint!(optimizer::MyOptimizer, graph::DAG)
        while !fixpoint_reached(optimizer, graph)
            optimize_step!(optimizer, graph)
