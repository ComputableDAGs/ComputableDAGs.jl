    is_valid_node(graph::DAG, node::Node)

Verify that a given node is valid in the graph. Call like `@test is_valid_node(g, n)`. Uses `@assert` to fail if something is invalid but also provide an error message.

This function is very performance intensive and should only be used when testing or debugging.

See also this function's specific versions for the concrete Node types [`is_valid(graph::DAG, node::ComputeTaskNode)`](@ref) and [`is_valid(graph::DAG, node::DataTaskNode)`](@ref).
